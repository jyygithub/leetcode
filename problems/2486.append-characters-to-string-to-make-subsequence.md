**Description**

You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun appendCharacters(s: String, t: String): Int {
        var position = 0
        for (letter in s) {
            if (letter == t[position]) position++
            if (position == t.length) break
        }
        return t.length - position
    }
}
```

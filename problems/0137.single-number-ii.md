**Description**

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun singleNumber(nums: IntArray): Int {
        var a = 0
        var b = 0
        for (num in nums) {
            b = a.inv() and (b xor num)
            a = b.inv() and (a xor num)
        }
        return b
    }
}
```

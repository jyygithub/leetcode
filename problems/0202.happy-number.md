**Description**

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {

    fun isHappy(n: Int): Boolean {
        var num = n
        val seen = HashSet<Int>()
        while (num != 1 && !seen.contains(num)) {
            seen.add(num)
            num = getNext(num)
        }
        return num == 1
    }

    private fun getNext(n: Int): Int {
        var num = n
        var totalSum = 0
        while (num > 0) {
            val d = num % 10
            num /= 10
            totalSum += d * d
        }
        return totalSum
    }
}
```

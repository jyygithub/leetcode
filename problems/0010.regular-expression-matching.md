**Description**

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

- '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
- '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun isMatch(s: String, p: String): Boolean {

    }
}
```

**Description**

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun isUgly(n: Int): Boolean {
        var num = n
        if (num <= 0) return false
        for (child in arrayOf(2, 3, 5)) {
            while (num % child == 0) {
                num /= child
            }
        }
        return num == 1
    }
}
```

**Description**

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun maxArea(height: IntArray): Int {
        var area = 0
        var start = 0
        var end = height.size - 1
        while (start < end) {
            area = kotlin.math.max(kotlin.math.min(height[start], height[end]) * (end - start), area)
            if (height[start] > height[end]) end--
            else start++
        }
        return area
    }
}
```

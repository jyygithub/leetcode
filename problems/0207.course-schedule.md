**Description**

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    private lateinit var edges: MutableList<MutableList<Int>>
    private lateinit var visited: IntArray
    private var valid = true

    fun canFinish(numCourses: Int, prerequisites: Array<IntArray>): Boolean {
        edges = mutableListOf()
        for (i in 0 until numCourses) {
            edges.add(mutableListOf())
        }
        visited = IntArray(numCourses)
        for (info in prerequisites) {
            edges[info[1]].add(info[0])
        }
        var i = 0
        while (i < numCourses && valid){
            if (visited[i] == 0) {
                dfs(i)
            }
            ++i
        }
        return valid
    }

    private fun dfs(u: Int) {
        visited[u] = 1
        for (v in edges[u]) {
            if (visited[v] == 0) {
                dfs(v)
                if (!valid) {
                    return
                }
            } else if (visited[v] == 1) {
                valid = false
                return
            }
        }
        visited[u] = 2
    }
}

**Description**

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Solution**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun twoSum(numbers: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
        var low = 0
        var high = numbers.size - 1
        while (low < high) {
            val sum = numbers[low] + numbers[high]
            if (sum == target) {
                return intArrayOf(low + 1, high + 1)
            } else if (sum < target) {
                ++low
            } else {
                --high
            }
        }
        return intArrayOf(-1, -1)
    }
}
```
